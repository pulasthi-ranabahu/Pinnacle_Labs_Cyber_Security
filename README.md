## üìù About

This repository is your one-stop resource for completing the Pinnacle Labs internship tasks.  
Each script is designed for practical learning, security research, and demonstration.  
You can use these tools individually or as part of a larger security toolkit.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Text Encryption**: Encrypt and decrypt text using AES, DES, and RSA.
- **Keylogger Software**: Research tool for monitoring keystrokes and understanding keylogger threats.
- **Image Encryption**: Secure image files to protect visual data.
- **Password Analyzer**: Evaluate and improve password strength.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pulasthi-ranabahu/Pinnacle_Labs_Cyber_Security
   cd Pinnacle_Labs_Cyber_Security
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography pycryptodome
   ```
   *Each script may have additional dependencies; see individual script READMEs for details.*

---

## üí° Usage

Run any script from the command line. For example, to use the Text Encrypter:

```bash
python Text_Encrypter.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts for each tool.  
Check each script's README for detailed instructions and examples.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Import Errors in VSCode

If you see warnings like  
`Import "cryptography.hazmat.primitives" could not be resolved`  
or  
`Import "Crypto.Cipher" could not be resolved`  
please follow these steps:

1. **Install the required packages**  
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography pycryptodome
   ```

2. **Select the correct Python interpreter in VSCode**  
   - Click the Python version shown in the bottom bar of VSCode.
   - Choose the interpreter where you installed the packages (e.g., your virtual environment or system Python).

3. **Restart VSCode**  
   Sometimes VSCode needs to be restarted to recognize new packages.

4. **Test your imports**  
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python
   ```
   Then type:
   ```python
   from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher
   from Crypto.Cipher import DES
   ```
   If you see no errors, your environment is set up.

5. **Still having issues?**  
   - Make sure you are not running import statements directly in PowerShell or CMD.  
   - Only run them in a `.py` script or in the Python interactive shell (`python` command).
