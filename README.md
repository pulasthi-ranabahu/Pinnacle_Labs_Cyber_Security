## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Import Errors

If you see warnings like  
`Import "cryptography.hazmat.primitives" could not be resolved`  
or  
`Import "Crypto.Cipher" could not be resolved`  
in VSCode or your terminal, follow these steps:

1. **Install the required packages**  
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography pycryptodome
   ```

2. **Select the correct Python interpreter in VSCode**  
   - Click the Python version shown in the bottom bar of VSCode.
   - Choose the interpreter where you installed the packages (e.g., your virtual environment or system Python).

3. **Restart VSCode**  
   Sometimes VSCode needs to be restarted to recognize new packages.

4. **Test your imports**  
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python
   ```
   Then type:
   ```python
   from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher
   from Crypto.Cipher import DES
   ```
   If you see no errors, your environment is set up.

5. **Do not run import statements in PowerShell or CMD directly**  
   Only use them in a `.py` script or in the Python interactive shell (`python` command).
